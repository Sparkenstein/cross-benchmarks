# cross-benchmarks

This is not a tool. it's an informative repository to compare frameworks from multiple languages. I only pick the code written by author in respective framework's `example` section usually, hello-world and test it directly. this is not a test to push frameworks to their limits, rather, it's a test for how frameworks behave in their default settings.
